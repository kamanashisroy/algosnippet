There are many ways to solve subset sum problem.

- [Divide and conquer](divide_and_conquer/)
- [Dinamic programming](dinamic/)

If the subset-sum problem is designed for k elements where k = 2, the problem statements is like the following,

"Given n integers, determine a pair of numbers whose sum is x"
- [We can do it by divide and conquer](pairsum_by_divide/), It takes `BigO(n*log n)` time.
- [We can do it by distribution(counting)](pairsum_by_counting/), It takes `BigO(n)` time.
