Graph 
=======

Here is my practice code of all the graph related algorithms.

- [Tree](../data_structure/tree)
- [Breadth-first Search](searching/bfs)
- [Depth-first Search](searching/dfs)
- [Shortest path search](searching/shortest_path)
	- [Dijkstra Algorithm](searching/shortest_path/dijkstra)
	- [Floyd Warshall's algorithm](searching/shortest_path/floyd_warshall)
	- [Dynamic programming](searching/shortest_path/dynamic_undirected)
	- [Bellman Ford algorithm](searching/shortest_path/bellman_ford)
- [Finding minimum spanning tree](minimum_spanning_tree)
	- [Kruskal's algorithm](minimum_spanning_tree/kruskal)
	- [Prim's algorithm](minimum_spanning_tree/prim)

Approaches
===========

- [Best-first Search](searching/best_first_search)
    - [`A-*`](searching/a_star_search)
    - [Greedy Best-First Search](searching/greedy_best_first_search)


Graph representation
====================

If the graph is represented as adjacency-list then the space cost is O(|E|+|V|). If it is represented as adjacency-matrix then it takes O(|V|^2) space.
