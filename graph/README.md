Graph 
=======

Here is my practice code of all the graph related algorithms.

- [Breadth-first Search](bfs)
- [Depth-first Search](dfs)
- Shortest path search
	- [Dijkstra Algorithm](dijkstra)
	- [Floyd Warshall's algorithm](floyd_warshall)
	- [Dynamic programming](dynamic_undirected)
	- [Bellman Ford algorithm](bellman_ford)


Note Bellman-ford and Floyd-Warshall are very similar algorithms. And Dijkstra and Breadth-first search are very similar algorithms.
