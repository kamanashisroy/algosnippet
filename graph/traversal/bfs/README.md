Breadth-first-search has time complexity of `O(|V| + |E|)`. The space complexity in the worst case is O(|V|);

Note, the javascript implementation here uses adjucency matrix, for which the bfs takes `Theta(|V|^2)`.

BFS can be used to find shortest path in unweighted graph. It can also be used to check if a graph is bipartate.
