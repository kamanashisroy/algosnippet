In dfs the nodes have two stages. One is marking(on process) and another is finished.

And dfs can be implemented using recursive form and it can be done using stack. But in **recursive form we can easily know the finishing time of the node**. Here this property is used to do topological sort.

The cost of topsort is O(|V| + |E|) .
