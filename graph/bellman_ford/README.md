Bellman-Rord is very similar like Floyd-Warshall algorithm. But the previous finds the shortest path from single source and the other finds the shortest distance from all the nodes. The time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(|E|\*|V|).

#### test input

The input files contain the number of nodes and number of edges. The last parameter is the root node identifier-number.The nodes are numbered by 0,1,2...n. 
5 8 0
It is followed by the directed edges and weights.
0 1 4
The line above means there is a directed edge from node 0 to node 1 of weight 4.
