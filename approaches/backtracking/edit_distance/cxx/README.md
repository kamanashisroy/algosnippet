Edit distance/Levenshtein distance problem
===========================================

Edit distance is the minimum number of edit needed to convert one given string to other given string.

                Edit Distance = Number of edits
Source-string -------------------------------------> Destination-string

The problem can be solved by,

- *Backtracking*
- Dynamic Programming
- `A*`/Dijkstra like algorithm

When the two string has equal length, the edit distance may be comparable to hamming distance.
