Here we are going to solve the interval problem by distribution and bucketing.


Given a number of intervals, we can get the upper and lower bound of the intervals, and make for example, m(suppose 100) buckets. Now depending on the starting and ending position we can put the intervals in such buckets. When we are asked for specific interval `(a,b)` we can look into the buckets involving the values `a` and `b` to find the overlapping intervals.
