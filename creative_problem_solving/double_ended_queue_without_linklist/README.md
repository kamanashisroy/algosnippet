A stack or queue can be implemented in an array. Array implementation gives the advantage of reduced cache-miss.

While python and C++ implemented the double ended queue in linked-list (which contrary to array increases cache-miss), there is a way to use two array/vector(C++)/list(python) to implement double-ended queue.
