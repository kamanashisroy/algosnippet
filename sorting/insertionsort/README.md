Insertion sort is fast when the input is small(14).

It is still inversion-bound and comparison-based algorithm.

It can be optimized by a sorted state check. And it can be optimized using binary search.

In best case the running time is BigO(n). And on average it is BigO(n^2).

Insertion sort can be optimized by the idea of devide and conquer for example in merge sort.
