Selection sort is little different from Insertion sort while in both case the lower indexes of array are sorted first. But unline Insertion sort Selection sort the lower indexes of array always in final sorted order.

Selection sort has running time of BigO(n^2). And it is not necessarily a stable sort.

The running time of Selection sort can be improved by a heap which is done in heapsort.
